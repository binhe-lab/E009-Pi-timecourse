y<-DGEList(count=rawdata[,1:4],genes=rawdata[,5]) ##small parentheses means function, [,]means lines or rows of matrix 

2# Normalization

y<-calcNormFactors(y) ##TMM normalization, based on the assumption that the majority of genes are not DEGs, method = c("TMM","RLE","upperquartile")
## The leading log-fold-change is the average (root-mean-square) of the largest absolute log-foldchanges between each pair of samples.
